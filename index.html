        <p>I love you so much Sarah do you know that? I couldn't keep this secret away from you. I can't keep any secrets from you, I can't stay away from you, I can't stay without seeing you, I can't sleep if you're not by my side. But someone likes to mute themselves and acts like a hypocrite about it when I do the same. But It's okay love, you can mute as long as you are on call. Sometimes I wish I could stay up all night and day like you so I could talk to you more, hear your voice more, hear your smile more, more and more but never enough. I want all of you, all of your time, all of your attention, and all of your love. I know I'm selfish for asking all of you, but I can't help it when I gave all of myself to you. I give you everything and do everything for my bubs but she still wants more and I pray to God that he makes us get married to each other so I can keep giving her all of my love like I am right now. I know I can't physically be there with you and express all of my love, but I should at least write letters and make this website to tell her just how much obsessed i am with her. I really want you Sarah, not a day has gone by where I didn't ask for you in my prayers. If that's not love, I don't know what is. I wish I kept this website project a secret from you just to see your reaction when you open this website, but I knew my baby would be more happy if I told her now than surprise her later. You told me you don't like surprises. I always want to make sure you are comfortable in whatever I do, whatever I say or whatever I ask of you. Sometimes I say things that doesn't make any sense to you and I feel really bad. I wish I could explain myself better, more clear so that the one person I want to spend my life with understood everything in a second. But I know we spoke about this many times, if there is any confusion we ask one another and clear things up. And It will be that way my love, I want to do everything for you. I just want to see you happy Sarah, from the moment I fell in love with you till now and even after countless years. Your smile is so precious to me  yet you hide it on video calls. Your laughter is my favorite yet you feel indifferent towards it. Everything about you is special to me baby. I want to take care of you everyday, cook for you. take you to groceries, mall, restaurants, parks, and yes library, go on long drives with you while playing our songs, watch movies together while cuddling and so much more. Please don't ever stay upset with me for too long, not more than a day because I can't stay away from you for that long Sarah. You are in everything, my thoughts, prayers, and ofc here in my heart. I love you for eternity and even after that and after that and after that and after that and after that and after that and whatever holds next for us I will love you endlessly, so gently hold my hand and never let go.</p>
